            <h3>What Causes Global Warming?</h3>
            <p>There a multiple factors that go into climate change, such as solar flares, solar cycles, cloud cover,and greenhouse gas emissions. The only one that is unnatural/caused by humans, however, is greenhouse gas emissions (otherwise known as GHG emissions). Greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere every day en masse, and in some countries there is no limit to the amount of GHG’s being released.</p>

            <h3>What Are Greenhouse Gases?</h3>
            <p> Greenhouse gases are defined as gases that contributes to the greenhouse effect by absorbing infared radiation (i.e. sunlight). Some major greenhouse gases include Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous Oxide (N2O), Ozone (O3), and a variety of other gases. These gases are released on a massive scale by the human population and our endeavors, and it’s causing issues.</p>
            <h3> How Much Is Being Released?</h3>
            <p> In 2015, the US alone generated roughly 67,000,000 tons of greenhouse gases. We generate fossil fuels in a variety of manners, from burning fossil fuels to raising cows.</p>
            <p>The largest contributor to GHG emissions is electricity production, and ironically, it’s probably the easiest to turn green. 29% of US greenhouse gas emissions come from electricity production. To produce electricity, fossil fuels are burned and the energy is converted into electricity. Even though green forms of electricity production are widely availible, 67% of our electricity comes from fossil fuels.</p>
            <p> The next largest contributor to fossil fuels is transportation. Cars, trucks, ships, trains, airplanes, and virtually every other mode of transportation invented after 1780 use some sort of fossil fuel as a fuel (as the name implies). Transportation contributes to 27% of our GHG emissions. </p>
            <p> Industry contributes 21% of the US’ greenhouse gas emissions. This is includes everything from producing Twinkies to manufacturing cars, and the GHG’s are released through burning fossil fuels for energy and chemical reactions used to produce materials.</p>
            <p> The last 21% of the US’ greenohsue gas emissions come from Agricultural, Buisiness, and Residential endeavors. For bvvuisiness and residential (12%) endeavors, GHG’s are burned to provide heat that comforts residents of buildings. For agricultural (9%) enedeavors, GHG’s are produced through agricultural soils, certain processes of harvesting rice, and livestock (especially cattle) bodily gases (i.e. burps).</p>
