                    <h3>What Is Being Done About It?</h3> <br>
                    <p>You would think that authorities would limit these harmful gases since they are so obviously hurting planet Earth. The problem is, the authorities don’t believe in global warming. President Donald Trump has claimed that climate change is a “hoax created by the Chinese”, and has refused to admit that greenhouse gases are harming our planet. He has also nullified many acts put into place to limit GHG emissions.</p> <br>

                    <p>Despite the leader of the world’s leading country denying its existence, many other countries are making efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fight global warming. For instance, the Paris Climate Accord, which sets regulations for GHG emissions, was signed by 196 countries (one of which was the US, but President Trump decided to pull out of this agreement). </p> <br>

                    <p>Carbon markets are a legal system that allows companies to release certain amounts of greenhouse gases based on their size and productivity. When companies exceed the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allotted to them by the government, they must pay a large fine, and this encourage companies to release as little GHG as possible. </p><br>

                    <p> Along with legal systems that combat climate change, there are also organizations that advocate a green lifestyle. Organizations such as 350.org, Sierra Club, and Greenpeace raise awareness for issues that climate change cause. Things such as these are the hope of our planet.</p><br>

                    <h3>What Can you Do?</h3><br>
                    <p> Hopefully, the content of this website has been enough to convince you that climate change is real and that it is a major threat to the future of this planet. If that is the case, then you are probably ready to to abandon some of your not-so-green ways and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p><br>

                    <p>There are many ways that the average citizen can help fight climate change. However, the most important is the change to green sources of energy and technology that runs on green energy. The most available way of doing these is to switch to an electric car. This would help reduce fossil fuel usage and greenhouse gas emissions by lessening the amount of gasoline that is burned for transportation. Another great way to do help the cause is to buy solar panels. This provides green energy not only for you, but also for the electricity provider that is in your area (such as PG&amp;E). This would encourage them to burn less fossil fuels to produce electricity.</p><br>

                    <p>Possibly the best way of helping to reduce greenhouse gases is by voting on bills that put a legal limit on GHG emissions released by corporations, which are one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases. If everyone would do things such as these, global warming would barley be an issue. Remember, this world is in your hands.</p><br>
