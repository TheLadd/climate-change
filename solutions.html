                <h3>What Is Being Done About It?</h3>
                <p>You would think that authorities would limit these harmful gases since they are so obviously hurting planet Earth. The problem is, the authorities don’t believe in global warming. President Donald Trump has claimed that climate change is a “hoax created by the Chinese”, and has refused to admit that greenhouse gases are harming our planet. He has also nullified many acts put into place to limit GHG emissions.</p>

                <p>Despite the leader of the world’s leading country denying its existence, many other countries are making efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fight global warming. For instance, the Paris Climate Accord, which sets regulations for GHG emissions, was signed by 196 countries (one of which was the US, but President Trump decided to pull out of this agreement). </p>

                <p>Carbon markets are a legal system that allows companies to release certain amounts of greenhouse gases based on their size and productivity. When companies exceed the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allotted to them by the government, they must pay a large fine, and this encourage companies to release as little GHG as possible. </p>

                <p> Along with legal systems that combat climate change, there are also organizations that advocate a green lifestyle. Organizations such as 350.org, Sierra Club, and Greenpeace raise awareness for issues that climate change cause. Things such as these are the hope of our planet.</p>
