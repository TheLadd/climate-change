                <p>While many people have already accepted that climate change is real, and that it is being caused by human pollution, there is still a suprising portion of the population that does not. For those people, we have provided a list of evidence, containing things such as the early melting of snow and ocean acidification.

                    <h3>Glaciers Are Shrinking</h3>
                    <p>Ice Sheets are melting all around the world, causing them to shrink. For Example, Greenland lost 250 cubic kilometers of ice per year between 2002 and 2005. That’s a total of 1,250 cubic kilometers in just five years! That’s as much as what’s contained in all of the world’s rivers!

                    <p> The acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by about 30 percent since the beginning of the industrial revolution. The amount of CO2 absorbed by the upper layer of the oceans is increasing by about 2 million tons per year.</p>
