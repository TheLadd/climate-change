                <h3>Glaciers Are Shrinking</h3>
                <p>Ice Sheets are melting all around the world, causing them to shrink. For Example, Greenland lost 250 cubic kilometers of ice per year between 2002 and 2005. That’s a total of 1,250 cubic kilometers in just five years! That’s as much as what’s contained in all of the world’s rivers!
