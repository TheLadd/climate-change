            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Our planet is heating up, there’s no denying that. Every year, little by little, global temperature is rising, and a lot of issues come along with this heat. You know this already, but what you may not know is why this is happening or what exactly these climate change-related issues are.<br><br>This website is designed to inform you about these types of things, in hopes that you will take a stand in defense of our planet, in hopes you will help protect the environments of Earth’s inhabitants, in hopes that you will help preserve this planet for our future generations.</p>
